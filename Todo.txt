= to do

== 0.1.0
* improve auto generation of attributes, clean it up
* don't bother wrapping lvm create/delete etc commands, too complex, just 
  provide a standard lvm.raw('lvcreate foo'), that traps errors to do work at 
  this level for now
* proper documentation
* basic test suite
* compatibility check and warning, pass flag to shutup
